        <p> I am presently a senior at <a target="_blank" href="https://bsd405.org/interlake/">Interlake High School</a> in Bellevue, Washington. I have a deep interest in science, especially chemistry and physics. This website is a dedication to both subjects. My website's name, <b>hsnberg</b>, is an abridged form of <i>Heisenberg</i>. My chemistry inspiration for <i>Heisenberg</i> comes from Walter White, the main character in <b>Br</b>eaking <b>Ba</b>d who uses the name <i>Heisenberg</i> as an alias. 
        Now please do not tell me that you have not watched <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sonypictures.com/tv/breakingbad">Breaking Bad</a>! 
        My physics inspiration for <i>Heisenberg</i> comes from the physicist Werner Heisenberg, discoverer of the <a target="_blank" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.</a></p>
            <p>I use my knowledge of chemistry and physics to innovate and try out new ideas that I occassionally get. I spend most of my time in chemistry and physics either studying or preparing for science competitions (it's my last year in high school, gotta make it count!).
               </p>
                   <p>Now, I am not trying to become a chemistry and physics encyclopedia (although I wouldn't complain if I was one). In the disciplines of chemistry and physics lie a few sub-disciplines that are my passions. In chemistry, the sub-disciplines I love are organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. In physics, the sub-disciplines I love are electromagnetism, nuclear physics, quantum physics, and general and special relativity.</p>
 
        <p>One of my most favorite parts of science is experimentation. I often implement my original ideas in real life, and it is very exciting to see the results (or shortcomings, for that matter) of my work. In chemistry labs, I often either research the properties of different reactions or try to synthesize interesting compounds using my knowledge of chemical reactions. In my physics research, I build strong magnetic fields and find applications for them. However, it often is the case that I will go on a tangent and do cool chemistry and physics tricks! </p>

        Apart from chemistry and physics, my hobbies include playing music and chess. I play the piano, western flute, and the Indian flute (called the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri">bansuri</a>). Chess is my favorite board game, with my favorite opening being the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chess.com/openings/Ruy-Lopez-Opening">Ruy Lopez</a>. I also enjoy traveling around the world. The vacation picture upi see is from my trip to Cancun, Mexico. As I was roaming the narrow streets of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Isla+Mujeres/@21.2320929,-86.7420182,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8f4c255cc7546269:0x31c329d38783bdbf!8m2!3d21.2321799!4d-86.7340934!16zL20vMDFiaDB0?entry=ttu">Isla Mujeres</a> there was this person with his pet Iguana <i>Bobby</i>. He was more than happy to share <i>Bobby</i> with me for a photograph. I had so many other awesome experiences in this trip!</p>

        <p>By the way, I really enjoy sharing my love for chemistry. You can catch me on <a target="_blank" href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/113146/shiv-mehrotra">Chemistry Stack Exchange</a>,  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/org_chem_god/">Reddit</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://brainly.com/app/profile/44193379/answers">Brainly</a> responding to threads where I can contribute.</p>
        <p> If you enjoy chess, no matter what part of the world you are in, why not play a game with me online on <a target="_balnk" href="https://www.chess.com/member/gm_shivmehrotra">chess.com</a>?</p>
        <p>That should be all about <b>hsnberg</b>! Hope you enjoy my website!</p>
