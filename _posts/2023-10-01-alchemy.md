I play both the Western Flute as well as the Indian Bamboo flute also known as the _<i>_Bansuri_. Here are pictures of me performing on stage. My dressing is Western for teh Flute and Indian for the Bansuri. For my Indian attire, I am wearing kurta pajama which is typical Indian mens' attire and sitting with my legs crossed which is how musicians from India perform.
