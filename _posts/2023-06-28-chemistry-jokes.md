Here's a collection of my all-time favorite one liner jokes in Chemistry. Reading through them makes me see the lighter side of Chemistry. 

_It goes without saying that science isn't everyone's favorite subject in school. While some excel at biology and chemistry, others might not find it fun at all. A great way to make any subject more relatable and fun is to add humor to a lesson. Whether you're looking for kid-friendly jokes or more mature jokes, there is tons of material out there. In other words, if you think chemistry can't be funny, you're wrong. From knock-knock jokes about the periodic table of elements to corny jokes about protons, neutrons, and atoms, to an endless list of chemistry puns, there are plenty of options to make you smile. If you're a student, use these jokes to get on your teacher's good side, and if you're a teacher, use these to get your students to crack a smile after a particularly tough pop quiz._


#### First, warm up to these one-liners
1. If you're not part of the solution … <b>you're part of the precipitate.</b>
1. Old chemists never die. <b>They just stop reacting!</b>
1. Wait, are all these jokes too basic for you? <b>Because I see no reaction.</b>
1. Are you made of copper and tellurim? <b>Because you're CuTe.</b>
1. I'd give you some more chemistry jokes, <b>but all the good ones argon.</b>
1. Guys, stop it with the puns. <b>We've all sulfured enough.</b>

#### Now, the bar collection
1. A neutron walks into a bar and asks the bartender how much a drink costs.
"For you, no charge."
1. Helium walks into a bar. The bartender says, "We don't serve noble gasses here." Helium doesn't react.
1. Oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, sodium, and phosphorous walk into a bar."OH SNaP!" says the bartender.
1. Fluorine and chlorine walk into a bar. The bartender greets them: “Halo gens”
