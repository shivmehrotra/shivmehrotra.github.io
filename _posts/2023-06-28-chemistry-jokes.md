Here's a collection of my all-time favorite one liner jokes in chemistry. Reading through them makes me see the lighter side of chemistry. 

#### The one-liners
1. If you're not part of the solution … <b>you're part of the precipitate.</b>
1. Old chemists never die. <b>They just stop reacting!</b>
1. Wait, are all these jokes too basic for you? <b>Because I see no reaction.</b>
1. Are you made of copper and tellurim? <b>Because you're CuTe.</b>
1. I'd give you some more chemistry jokes, <b>but all the good ones argon.</b>
1. Guys, stop it with the puns. <b>We've all sulfured enough.</b>

#### The bar collection
1. A neutron walks into a bar and asks the bartender how much a drink costs.
>The bartender says, "For you, no charge."
1. Helium walks into a bar. The bartender says, "We don't serve noble gasses here." 
>Helium doesn't react.
1. Oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, sodium, and phosphorous walk into a bar.
>"OH SNaP" says the bartender.
1. Fluorine and chlorine walk into a bar. 
>The bartender greets them: “Halo gens”
