<p><i>That is me, next to my organic chemistry professor <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/ids/staff/jennie-mayer/">Jennie Mayer</a> on Halloween.</i></p>

<p>I dressed up as Oppenheimer, while professor Mayer dressed up as Mary Poppins. I had my tweed suit, brown tie, and the K-6 pin from the movie <i>Oppenheimer</i>. To top it off, I wore a brown pork pie hat, just like the real Oppenheimer did. Many loved my costume, but I stumbled across a common question all the time: what does the K-6 on my pin mean?

<p>I had not actually thought about it: what DOES the K-6 on my pin mean? Some joked around and said it meant kindergarten to sixth grade, and that my costume was just a fancily dressed elementary school teacher. However, with the question stuck in my mind, I got to researching the K-6 pin.</p>

<p>Through my research, I have found that the K-6 pin was the identification number given to the real Oppenheimer when he worked at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory. Below is an actual image of Oppenheimer with this identification.

<p>The fact that the movie <i> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oppenheimermovie.com/">Oppenheimer</a></i> included the K-6 pin has grown my appreciation for the movie. To the custom-made silver New Mexico belt buckle, wide brown tie, and light brown pork pie hat, <i>Oppenheimer</i> has definetly done its research.</p>

<p>With a perfect main character, a perfect movie naturally follows ...</p>
<p>... and inspires.</p>

<p>Happy Halloween!</p>
