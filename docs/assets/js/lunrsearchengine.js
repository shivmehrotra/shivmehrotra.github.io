    "body": "                Say my name.     Shiv Mehrotra.   YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT!         I am presently a senior at Interlake High School in Bellevue, Washington. I have a deep interest in science, especially chemistry and physics. This website is a dedication to both subjects. My website's name, hsnberg, is an abridged form of Heisenberg. My chemistry inspiration for Heisenberg comes from Walter White, the main character in Breaking Bad who uses the name Heisenberg as an alias.     Now please do not tell me that you have not watched Breaking Bad!     My physics inspiration for Heisenberg comes from the physicist Werner Heisenberg, discoverer of the  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.       I use my knowledge of chemistry and physics to innovate and try out new ideas that I occassionally get. I spend most of my time in chemistry and physics either studying or preparing for science competitions (it's my last year in high school, gotta make it count!).                  Now, I am not trying to become a chemistry and physics encyclopedia (although I wouldn't complain if I was one). In the disciplines of chemistry and physics lie a few sub-disciplines that are my passions. In chemistry, the sub-disciplines I love are organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. In physics, the sub-disciplines I love are electromagnetism, nuclear physics, quantum physics, and general and special relativity.      One of my most favorite parts of science is experimentation. I often implement my original ideas in real life, and it is very exciting to see the results (or shortcomings, for that matter) of my work. In chemistry labs, I often either research the properties of different reactions or try to synthesize interesting compounds using my knowledge of chemical reactions. In my physics research, I build strong magnetic fields and find applications for them. However, it often is the case that I will go on a tangent and do cool chemistry and physics tricks!             Apart from chemistry and physics, my hobbies include playing music and chess. I play the piano, western flute, and the Indian flute (called the bansuri). Chess is my favorite board game, with my favorite opening being the Ruy Lopez. I also enjoy traveling around the world. The vacation picture upi see is from my trip to Cancun, Mexico. As I was roaming the narrow streets of Isla Mujeres there was this person with his pet Iguana Bobby. He was more than happy to share Bobby with me for a photograph. I had so many other awesome experiences in this trip!     By the way, I really enjoy sharing my love for chemistry. You can catch me on Chemistry Stack Exchange, Reddit or Brainly responding to threads where I can contribute.      If you enjoy chess, no matter what part of the world you are in, why not play a game with me online on chess. com?     That should be all about hsnberg! Hope you enjoy my website!             "

    "title": "The Chemistry of Hand Warmers",
    "body": "2024/02/19 - Hello everybody! I have been busy this winter having the opportunity to participate in many chemical experiments and other experiences, but now I’m back! It is still winter, but now it’s February, the coldest month of winter. If you are freezing, you have come to the right place! Today we will be talking about the chemistry of hand warmers! Hand Warmers and … more Hand Warmers: Before we begin, you should know that there is not one type of hand warmer. Different types of hand warmers work through different types of changes, either physical or chemical. However, all hand warmers revolve around one underlying principle: enthalpy. What is Enthalpy?: Enthalpy is a measure of the amount of heat energy in a system. The system is whatever is undergoing a physical or chemical change, whether it be wood burning into ash or ice melting into water that annoyingly dilutes your glass of soda. The change in enthalpy is simply a measure of the amount of heat energy transferred from or to the system. The symbol for the change in enthalpy is ΔH. If ΔH is positive for a system, it means whatever change is occurring to the system is causing the system to absorb heat energy from its surroundings, making the system feel cold to the touch. A negative ΔH means that the change to the system is causing the system to release heat energy into its surroundings, making the system feel warm to the touch. Changes that cause a positive ΔH are called endothermic changes, and changes that cause a negative ΔH are called exothermic changes. For example, water evaporating into water vapor is an endothermic change. To turn water into water vapor, virtually all the attraction between the water molecules in the water must be overcome, which requires the water to absorb heat energy from its surroundings. Now let’s apply the concept of enthalpy to hand warmers! Air-Activated Hand Warmers: To warm your hands, air-activated hand warmers use an exothermic chemical reaction. That is, the components inside the hand warmer react with each other, breaking and forming bonds to release heat energy. Breaking bonds requires absorbing heat energy and forming bonds releases heat energy. Exothermic chemical reactions are chemical reactions where the heat energy released by the formation of bonds is more than the absorption of heat energy through the breakage of bonds, causing a net release of heat energy. The specific exothermic chemical reaction in question is the rusting of iron; Iron reacts with oxygen in the air to form ferric oxide, commonly known as rust.  The unbalanced chemical equation for iron rusting. The rusting process is slow, so air-activated hand warmers use water and salt to speed up the rusting process. A simplified diagram of an air-activated hand warmer is shown below: The grey barrier is broken to combine the components of the hand warmer. Combustion Hand Warmers: Combustion hand warmers use an exothermic reaction called combustion, commonly called burning, to provide warmth. Combustion hand warmers fall into two main categories: lighter fluid hand warmers and charcoal hand warmers. Lighter Fluid Hand Warmers: Lighter fluid hand warmers involve the combustion of lighter fluid with the addition of a catalyst. The catalyst allows for the combustion reaction to occur at a temperature low enough to prevent a fire. The lighter fluid and catalyst are placed in a small metal container and then lit to initiate the combustion reaction. Then, the metal container is covered to prevent hand burns from usage of the hand warmer.  The advantage of such a warmer is that it is one of the best hand warmers in terms of amount of warmth provided and duration of warmth provided. Furthermore, the covered metal container can be used indefinitely. While the catalyst – which might contain the rare metal platinum – does not last forever, the catalyst is small and can last for years before needing to be replaced. The main problem with lighter fluid hand warmers is that burning lighter fluid, a gas commonly known as petroleum naphtha, contributes to global warming; reuse of the hand warmer requires refueling it with lighter fluid. Charcoal Hand Warmers: Charcoal hand warmers consist of a covered metal container; the cover is to prevent hand burns from usage of the hand warmer. A charcoal stick is lit on both ends and then extinguished, causing smoldering of the charcoal. The charcoal is then placed in the covered metal container.  While the charcoal hand warmer experiences the same benefits of the lighter fluid hand warmer on top of the low cost of charcoal sticks, it suffers from the same disadvantage of the lighter fluid: burning charcoal sticks, which must be replaced every time the hand warmer is reused, contributes to global warming. Electric Hand Warmers: Unlike the hand warmers we have covered so far, electric hand warmers work using a physical process. Electric hand warmers consist of a circuit containing a battery and a conductive material that has a significant amount of resistance. The outer electrons of the atoms in the somewhat conductive material are free to flow around through the material, creating a “sea of electrons” and a lattice of cations (positively charged ions).  When the hand warmer is turned on, a current is produced, and the electrons start moving. As the electrons move, they bump into the cations. This bumping transfers kinetic energy, the energy an object has when it is moving, from the electrons to the cations, causing the cations to vibrate faster and faster. Since temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of the atoms and molecules in an object, the conductive material heats up.  While electric hand warmers can be recharged, the battery of the electric hand warmer will slowly deplete after each recharge, eventually needing to be replaced. Supersaturated Hand Warmers: I have been saving this one for last because it is my favorite type of hand warmer. Supersaturated hand warmers, like electric hand warmers, rely on a physical process of precipitation. For all substances, there exists a point at which no more of a substance can be dissolved in a solvent; the resulting mixture is called a saturated solution. The amount of a substance that can be dissolved in a solvent before a saturated solution is achieved is the solubility of the substance. Interestingly, the solubility of a solid or liquid substance increases as the temperature increases. This property of solubility can be utilized by creating a saturated solution (where the dissolved substance is either a solid or liquid) at a high temperature and then slowly cooling the saturated solution down to room temperature. This process creates a supersaturated solution, where the amount of substance dissolved in the solvent is greater than the solubility of the substance for that temperature. A supersaturated solution is metastable, meaning that it is only stable if it is not subjected to any significant disturbances. If I disturbed a supersaturated solution by dipping a pencil into the solution, the substance will start precipitating out of solution until a saturated solution is achieved. As some of the substance precipitates, attractions between the precipitating substance molecules form, releasing heat energy. However, to precipitate, the precipitating substance molecules must absorb heat energy to overcome their attractions with solvent molecules. I should also mention that the solvent molecules that were once attracted to the substance molecules will form attractions with other solvent molecules, releasing additional heat energy in the process. To be exothermic, the precipitation process has to release more heant energy than it absorbs. Below is a video that demonstrates cool ways to disturb a supersaturated solution: In most supersaturated hand warmers, a small metal disk is inside the supersaturated solution. The metal must be bent to disturb the supersaturated solution and cause some of the substance to precipitate out of the solution.  Also like electric hand warmers, supersaturated hand warmers are reusable. Once a supersaturated hand warmer has been used, heat the hand warmer in some boiling water so that the solubility of the substance increases, allowing for the precipitated susbtance to re-dissolve into the solvent. Once all of the precipitated substance has dissolved in the solvent, remove the hand warmer from the boiling water and let it cool to room temperature to create a supersaturated solution. Now your supersaturated hand warmer is ready for re-use! Stay warm folks! "

    "body": "2023/12/25 - Passionate about chemistry, I have participated in a prestigious science competition known as the USNCO. In this post, I will provide key information on how to crack the USNCO. Hope this benefits you and Merry Christmas! About USNCO: USNCO or United States National Chemistry Olympiad is a chemistry competition for high school students that starts of at the local levels, then the national level, and finally the international level. Moving up levels requires an excellent performance at the previous levels. Local Level: At the local level, there is only one exam - the aptly named local exam. A multiple-choice exam with 60 questions and a time limit of 110 minutes, the local exam covers a wide variety of topics, most of which are AP Chemistry exam topics. However, the difficulty in this exam comes from the questions that cover topics not on the AP Chemistry exam and the questions that involve clever applications of AP Chemistry exam concepts. If you do well, you will proceed to the national level. However, if more than two students from your school qualify to proceed to the national level, then only the two highest scoring students will proceed to the national level. When I attempted USNCO last year, 3 students from my school qualified that included me, but unfortunately I could not make it to the national level because of this rule. National Level: At the national level, there are three national exams that must be taken (it’s one national exam with three parts, but it truly feels like three exams). The first part/exam is another multiple-choice exam. The topics are not that much different than those at the local level, but the questions get significantly more difficult and sometimes require some insane ways of applying concepts. Even more challenging is the time constraint, 60 questions again, but now you only have 90 minutes to complete them. At the end of the exam there is a quick survey that you can complete, and it does not affect your score on the exam. The second part/exam is composed of eight free-response questions (eight questions with MANY parts, that is) and has a time limit of 105 minutes. The difficulty is on par with the first part/exam, but now you cannot rely on lucky guesses to score you a few extra points. The final part/exam is a lab practical. A lab practical is where you will perform an actual lab procedure or experiment to collect data to answer some lab questions given to you. In this lab practical you are given two questions (again, with many parts to each question) to complete within 90 minutes. If you really hit it out of the park, if you are in the top 20 at the national level, welcome to study camp. Study Camp: This is the final level before the famous International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO). This study camp is full of intense studying and practice. The top four students in study camp will represent the United States team in IChO. IChO: AP Chemistry topics will not cut it anymore. There is not much information about IChO, but the few recent IChO exams that I have reviewed are beyond anything I have ever seen. Physical chemistry, biochemistry, materials chemistry, no field of chemistry is left out. How to prepare: If you aspire to make it to the national and international levels of the Chemistry Olympiad, keep reading. Preparing for USNCO requires knowledge of many topics. Practice the topics listed below to ensure that you can complete USNCO exams within their time limits: Stoichiometry &amp; Solutions: Stoichiometry is often tested in questions 1-6 of USNCO multiple-choice exams. Stoichiometry is not difficult to learn, as it is applying basic arithmetic and algebra to quantify various amounts in chemistry. The difficulties that come with stoichiometry problems in USNCO exams include whether you can find the shortcut to solve the question quickly and the presence of other topics that are mixed with stoichiometric problems. A strong knowledge of solutions is also required. Knowledge of solutions includes solubilities of salts and the dissolution of salts. Descriptive/Laboratory: Descriptive/Laboratory chemistry is often tested in questions 7-12 of USNCO multiple-choice exams. Knowledge of descriptive/laboratory chemistry includes the uses of various laboratory glassware, the color of ions in solution, the flame test, reactions of different elements and compounds in liquids, error analysis, iodometry, and many other analytical techniques. States of Matter: States of matter are often tested in questions 13-18 of USNCO multiple-choice exams. Knowledge of states of matter is very broad, including ideal and non-ideal gas laws, intermolecular forces, boiling points, crystal structures, phase changes, and phase diagrams. Thermodynamics: Thermodynamics is often tested in questions 19-24 of USNCO multiple-choice exams. Knowledge of thermodynamics includes comparison of thermodynamic properties for various substances at various phases of matter and equations for heat/enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Kinetics: Kinetics is often tested in questions 25-30 of USNCO multiple-choice exams. Knowledge of kinetics includes the equation for the rate of a reaction, determining the change in concentrations of an occurring reaction, determining what the rate of a reaction is dependent upon, and the various properties of kinetically different reactions. Equilibria: Equilibria are often tested in questions 31-36 of USNCO multiple-choice exams. Knowledge of equilibria include Le Chatelier’s principle, determining whether a reaction is at equilibrium or not, equations involving the equilibrium constant, and determining the concentrations and pressures of both reactants and products at equilibrium. Redox: Redox is often tested in questions 37-42 of USNCO multiple-choice exams. Knowledge of redox includes oxidation states, determining oxidants and reductants, balancing redox reactions, electrochemistry, and any equations related to cell potentials in electrochemistry. This section tends to be difficult. Atomic Structure/Periodicity: Atomic structure/periodicity is often tested in questions 43-48 of USNCO multiple-choice exams.

    "body": "2023/12/09 - So, my school team competed in the 2023 Washington Mini-Teams chess tournament, and we won! The path to victory was a precarious five-match battle, and I am here to tell you all about it! A Hectic Morning: I set an alarm to wake up for the tournament, but my excitedness woke me up at six in the morning. I quickly grabbed my tournament fee money, some snacks, and planned to drive to the chess tournament. However, my parents were not comfortable with me driving so much on the highway, so Pranav managed to pick me up from my house at the last minute. My inactivity in chess tournaments had made my chess skills a bit dull, so I was hoping to use this tournament to determine where I stood. Game Round 1: Given the random pairings for the first round, the school team that played my school team comprised of beginner chess players. I won my game quickly as white, giving me time to eat some snacks before the next game started. Game Round 2: I played black, and this game was stressful. The person I played was unrated, meaning he did not have an official chess rating. With my experience of unrated players being that the unrated players were hidden masters of the game, I was quite nervous during the game. I stopped notating due to time trouble, but I still remember the game to be intense. The game was full of personal mistakes that made me feel as if I were going to be quitely suffocated in a cramped position. However, I managed to gain some activty of the queenside, but my opponent's 22. Nd2 made me wish I had moved my rook off of a8. Low on time, I gave up my advanced knight, losing most of my advantage. The game went on with me almost causing a three-fold repetition, creating a passed pawn, and overpowering my opponent's major pieces. Finally, my opponent resigned before my passed pawn became a queen. There was a lunch break after this game, giving me time to relax before my third game. Game Round 3: My third game was an awkward one. I played white, and the game went okay until my opponent blundered a pawn with 15. Re8, and I left to go to the bathroom after I played my 17th move. I came back to the board only to see that I only had five minutes on my clock. Thanfully, the time control included a time delay; I had five seconds for each move before the time on my clock would begin counting down. I played quickly from then on, and my opponent, for some strange reason, helped me by trading all of his pieces. The resulting game was a king and pawn endgame where I was a pawn up. Such a winning endgame is often taught early on in the life of a chess player, so my opponent resigned soon after. Game Round 4: The fourth game was wild and lousily played by me. I played black against an opponent who had a rating of about 1200. However, opponent had been practicing for a few years, so my opponent definetly did not play like a 1200. The opening led to a Breyer defense in the Ruy Lopez, and I had unfortunately forgotten how to play the Breyer defense. After many threats by my opponent and a blunder by me that my opponent luckily did not see, I opened up the position and won some material. We went into time trouble, and I won more material from then on while avoiding some very scary mating threats by my opponent's aggressive knight and queen. After a few trades, I emerged a rook up in an easy-to-win endgame. My opponent resigned immediately. Game Round 5: This was the toughest game for me. I was quite tired by this point, and I had run out of snacks. Dehydrated due to the fact that I had lost my water bottle (I later found it in the lost and found), I wasted away up-the-exchange advantage, eventually giving up the material advantage out of fear from the wrath my opponents' knights would impose upon my king. Both of us got into severe time trouble. I created a very advanced passed pawn, and my opponent found a tactic that made him win a pawn (if I took the pawn, I would be checkmated). I had three seconds left on my clock, and I was dodging very sneaky checkmate threats by overworking my pieces. Thankfully, while I had to give up some of my minor pieces and was down in material, I gained enough passed pawns to overpower his pieces with some very neat sacrifices. With my opponent having no way to stop the promotion of my passed pawn nor a way to utilize his passed pawns from my material sacrifices, he resigned. This was one of the only tournaments that I got a perfect score. Pranav also won all his games, but Blessington lost his Round 5 game. Blessington was up a full queen, but a last-ditch, easy-to-defuse checkmate trap by his opponent, combined with Blessington's half-closed eyes, led to a tragic loss for our team. Such tragic games have happened to me as well. It also explains why Blessington did not smile in the photo where our school team held the first place trophy. Final Standings: The final standings of the chess tournament. My school team won first place in the tournament with a score of 14/15. The school team in second place was so far behind us that if there was another round in the tournament, my school team would win no matter the outcome of the final round! Pranav and I were the only ones who scored a perfect 5/5 in the tournament, and we were awarded for our excellent performance with a nice medal. While Blessington unfortunately did not get the medal he deserved, his chess rating saw a healthy increase from his still successful score of 4/5. Now that I know my chess skills are not rusty, I will seek to play in more chess tournaments and improve my chess ranking. May the best player win! "

    "title": "From Alchemy to Chemistry",
    "body": "2023/11/11 - Alchemy was chemistry in its infancy. Everybody knows what fire is, it’s what happens when you burn something. Often used for cooking and warmth, fire comes from a chemical reaction called combustion. The combustion reaction is one of the first known chemical reactions that was controlled and utilized by humans. A combustion reaction is simple: you burn something with carbon and hydrogen (and maybe oxygen), and an immense amount of heat is released as the burning compound reacts with oxygen in the air to create carbon dioxide and water vapor (yes, fire makes water). Some of the first metals humans obtained in their pure form were copper, silver, and gold. Early on, humans learned that metals could be isolated and useful compounds could be created by heating metal ores and mixtures of compounds, respectively. This process gave rise to an early form of chemistry and metallurgy. As humans became acquainted with primitive chemical processes, a new field, often now called an early form of chemistry, was born: alchemy.  The birth of organic and inorganic chemistry. Alchemy was a field devoted to determining a way to make ordinary materials into gold, a highly valuable commodity. Nowadays, we know that this is not possible through chemical processes. Elements are substances that cannot be changed through chemical processes, and alchemists DEFINITELY did not know about nuclear processes that could make gold. As alchemists tried and tried and tried to create some magical substance that could turn everything into gold, alchemists accidentally discovered early chemical concepts, analytical techniques, and even new elements. Alchemist Jãbir ibn Hayyãn discovered that some substances could be broken down, while others could not. Other Arab alchemists discovered that each substance gave a colored flame when burned, what we now call the flame test. Alchemist Hennig Brand discovered the element phosphorus by boiling down his urine; he thought the golden color of urine held the secret to the magical substance that could turn anything into gold. Alchemists provided the necessary foundations for alchemy to transcend into chemistry. All they needed was some fresh air.  Alchemy had its flaws. An important theory in alchemy called the Phlogiston theory claimed the existence of a substance called phlogiston. Burning metal ores with a phlogiston-rich substance such as coal produced a metal that was infused with phlogiston from the coal. As metals rust, they lose their infused phlogiston, causing the metal to weaken and fall apart. The problem with this theory was that when metals rusted and LOST their infused phlogiston, the metals GAINED mass. The discovery of numerous gasses during the late 18th century would not only disprove the phlogiston theory, but it would also disprove the fundamentality of a common substance: air. In 1766, chemist Henry Cavendish reacted metal zinc and iron with strong acids and created what he called “inflammable gas” (hydrogen gas). Soon after, chemists Joseph Black and Joseph Priestley discovered phlogisticated air (carbon dioxide) and dephlogisticated air (oxygen gas), respectively. What made these discoveries so important was that a chemist named Antoine Lavoisier discovered that air was absorbed by metals to create rust, refuting the phlogiston theory. The discovery of oxygen gas made Antoine Lavoisier discover that air was not a fundamental substance, and a part of the air – oxygen gas – was the gas responsible for rusting metals. The discovery of oxygen gas also helped Antoine Lavoisier establish the law of conservation of mass. The law of conservation of mass states that mass is neither created nor lost in any process.  “If everything in chemistry is explained in a satisfactory manner without the help of phlogiston, it is by that reason alone infinitely probable that the principle does not exist; that it is a hypothetical body, a gratuitous supposition; indeed, it is in the principles of good logic, not to multiply bodies without necessity. ” - Antoine Lavoisier With the theory of phlogiston gone, chemistry was born. Since the work of Antoine Lavoisier, chemistry has grown remarkably. Batteries have been created, electricity has been used to isolate reactive elements, the theory of atoms has been established, subatomic particles have been discovered, even Albert Einstein contributed to chemistry by showing how the movement of atoms cause very light particles to move seemingly randomly.

I had my tweed suit, brown tie, and the K-6 pin from the movie Oppenheimer. To top it off, I wore a brown pork pie hat, just like the real Oppenheimer did. Many loved my costume, but I stumbled across a common question all the time: what does the K-6 on my pin mean?I had not actually thought about it: what DOES the K-6 on my pin mean? Some joked around and said it meant kindergarten to sixth grade, and that my costume was just a fancily dressed elementary school teacher. However, with the question stuck in my mind, I got to researching the K-6 pin. Through my research, I have found that the K-6 pin was the identification number given to the real Oppenheimer when he worked at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory. Below is an actual image of Oppenheimer with this identification. The fact that the movie Oppenheimer included the K-6 pin has grown my appreciation for the movie. To the custom-made silver New Mexico belt buckle, wide brown tie, and light brown pork pie hat, Oppenheimer has definetly done its research.  With a perfect main character, a perfect movie naturally follows . . . . . . and inspires. Happy Halloween!  "

    "title": "My musical journey",
    "body": "2023/08/11 - Elementary School: I began my music journey in fourth grade. My school music teacher made the whole class learn the recorder to prepare for fifth grade, where we would be allowed to choose from many instruments. To make learning music more fun, I remember my school music teacher gave everyone a “Recorder Karate” book. Each page contained a song and a few fingerings for the recorder. Just like karate, there were white, yellow, orange, green, purple, blue, red, brown, and black belts that could be earned. The first song was a “White Belt” song, so playing the song well would earn you a white belt. Each “belt” was a rubber band of whatever color of belt you earned wrapped around the end of the recorder. As you progress through the Recorder Karate book, the songs get more challenging, but the fact that you earned a colored “belt” was enough to get me to practice my recorder every day. Eventually, I got every “belt”, with my black belt being my greatest achievement at the time.  My recorder from 4th grade, honored with the 9 belts of progression. In fifth grade, students had a choice between joining band or orchestra. My perception of bands at that time came from marching bands, and I definetly did not want to march and move awkwardly as I played my instrument, so I joined orchesta. I took the violin because it was the least hassle to carry. I felt bad for the cello and double bass players as they lugged their large instruments. The violin was fun as I learned the fingerings on each string. It was when I got into middle school when I decided that I wanted more diversity in my music experience, so I switched to band. Amongst all the wind instruments, I spent hours trying to determine which instrument I would play. I landed on the flute since it was small and did not require delicate reeds that always need moistening. Middle School: I quickly learned that playing wind instruments is different than playing string instruments. There was no bow to play the sound for me, I had to shape my mouth correctly and blow into the flute. For the first month I was met with failure as I tried to muster one note. I began greatly disliking band, wanting to return to orchestra and continue playing my violin. Unfortunately, I could not change my class from band to orchestra, meaning I would have to continue playing the flute until the end of the school year. Thankfully, I did eventually get the hang of the flute. I had even grown to become passionate for playing the flute, so I continued band into seventh grade. By this time, I thought I played very well. My father also taught me some Hindi film tunes to play on the flute. Seventh grade saw me audition for entrance into the Bellevue Youth Symphony Orchestra, but I did not get accepted. I talked to my father about getting me flute lessons to improve my flute skills. That is how I met Mrs. Rose, my flute teacher.  Under Mrs. Rose's training, my flute skills improved immediately. There were numerous things that I was previously doing incorrectly on the flute that Mrs. Rose had me correct. There is no substitute for a good teacher.  By eighth grade, I had become confident in my flute skills, and I was accepted into the Bellevue Youth Symphony Orchestra. I also competed in some music competitions in my school. My highest point in Middle school music was when I got to play at the state level in WMEA All-State Junior in February 2020, which was right before COVID shut everything down. My school closed down for the rest of the year, and all of the music events I was involved in were cancelled. By the end of the school year, I quit Bellevue Youth Symphony Orchestra to focus on my new chapter of life: high school. High School: Picture of me playing the bansuri on a stage recital arranged by my Indian classical music teacher Satyajit ji ('ji' as a suffix to the name is used to convey respect to a person in Hindi). In high school, I continued to play the flute and have lessons on it, but since I quit playing for the high school band in 9th grade, playing the flute took a backseat as I was introduced to a new instrument: the Indian flute (bansuri). My father introduced me to the bansuri since he wanted me to play Hindi film songs, and I took a liking to the bansuri because it felt and was played similar to the flute. I was fortunate to have Satyajit Limaye, an Indian classical music teacher close to where I lived. I started lessons with him. On my first class, he asked me to play what I knew on the western flute. After hearing me play, he told my father that I would quickly pick up the bansuri. As I started playing the bansuri, I found one critical difference: holes in the flute were either fully open or fully closed, while holes in the bansuri were either fully open, fully closed, or half-open (or half-closed, which one is it?). Looking at how far my fingers could stretch, Satyajit ji got me started on a ‘G’ flute. Over a period of time, my fingers got used to the stretching. With practice, playing bansuri became second nature to me. … and beyond: When I look back over these years, learning to play 4 musical instruments was quite a journey, but this journey is not over. I want to take my musical skills, engagement, and appreciation to the next level. Thus, I plan to do a minor in music in college. Let’s see what is in store for me next. "

    "body": "2023/07/20 - “Colors are the smiles of Nature. ” - Leigh Hunt …and true colors are the smiles of chemistry. A Brief History of Colors: Colors have been used before writing was invented. Over 200 thousand years ago, early humans ground up rocks and minerals like hematite, also known as iron (iii) oxide for cave paintings and object decoreation. Hematite contains Fe3+ ions, which have a reddish-brown color. Early humans began doing primitive chemistry to create other colors. Adding water to hematite created limonite, a mixture of multiple minerals that has a yellow color.  One of the first synthetic pigments humans made was Egyptian Blue. As the name suggests, it was made by early Egyptians around 5000 years ago. Blue-colored substances are rare in nature, so Egyptian blue allowed for a synthetic substitute for obtaining a blue color. Egyptian blue is made by heating a ground-up mixture of sand, chalk, a source of copper, and embalming salts to about 900oC for 10 to 100 hours! Jumping ahead to the 19th century, many famous artists like Vincent van Gogh came to prominence. To create paintings, artists used paints that were, and still are, created by mixing a dried and ground-up pigment, a solvent to make the paint liquid, and a binder that keeps the pigment and solvent from separating. Vincent van Gogh's famous painting at the beginning of this post uses a multitude of compounds to create color. Black was made from crushed sources of carbon such as charred bones, white was made from lead salts (which we now know are toxic), red was made from toxic mercury compounds, blue was made from iron compounds, yellow was made from a mixture of lead and chromium, and a deep green was made from a mixture of copper and arsenic (arsenic being toxic, many artists, including Vincent van Gogh, grew insane from arsenic poisoning).  Further research: PBS Studios - The Chemistry of Color The Basics of Color: Before we can understand how chemistry plays a role in coloring compounds, we must learn why colors exist in the first place. Our eyes see a range of light called the visible spectrum; light outside of the visible spectrum range is invisible to our eyes. When an object has a color, it means that the object does not absorb, but reflect that color. For example, a red book does not absorb red light, so red light reflects off the book and reaches our eye, making the book look red. Therefore, if an object absorbs a color, the object’s color will be the color opposite to the absorbed color on the color wheel (two colors that are opposite to each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors).  Based on the color wheel above, an object that absorbs orange light will look blue, and an object that absorbs blue-green light will have an orange-red look. Transparent objects do not reflect light, but instead let unabsorbed light pass through itself. Black objects absorb almost all visible light, and white objects reflect almost all visible light. The Organic Side of Colors: So what gives compounds their color? Lycopene (a red pigment found in tomatoes), zeaxanthin (an orange-red compound found in wolfberries), lutein (a yellow compound found in egg yolks), chlorophyll b (a green compound found in plants), indigotin (a blue compound in indigo dye), and petunidin (a purple compound found in some grapes) are organic compounds whose colors range throughout the visible spectrum. The cause for the variety of color? Conjugated pi bonds. Pi bonds are in double and triple bonds in molecules. Conjugated pi bonds mean that there is an alternating pattern of double/triple bond, single bond, double/triple bond, single bond, etc.  Molecule of Beta Carotene showing an alternating pattern of 11 double bonds (conjugated pi bonds). It is orange-red in color and found in carrots. Compounds with a large continuous conjugated pi bond system generally absorb light in the visible spectrum. The larger the conjugated pi bond system, the longer the wavelength of light that is absorbed. This is because each pi bond has two energy levels: one in a bonding orbital and the other in an antibonding orbital. Each orbital holds up to two electrons, with the lower energy levels getting filled up before the higher energy levels. The bonding orbitals are the lower energy levels, while the antibonding orbitals are the higher energy levels. Thus, when there are n conjugated pi bonds in a conjugated pi bond system, there exist 2n electrons in the conjugated pi bond system, n bonding orbitals in the conjugated pi bond system, and n antibonding orbitals in the conjugated pi bond system. In the image below, antibonding orbitals are marked with a * HOMO = Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, LUMO = Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital The wavelength of light increases going from violet to red to light. As the wavelength of light increases, the energy of the light decreases. Usually, the conjugated pi bond system must have more than eight continuously conjugated pi bonds to go from absorbing UV light to visible light, producing a visible color. How about some examples? Isophorone (Colorless) Isophorone has a conjugated pi bond system of only two conjugated pi bonds. It is colorless. Lycopene (Red) Lycopene has a conjugated pi bond system of 11 conjugated pi bonds. It looks red because it absorbs green light; green and red are complimentary colors. Chlorophyll b (Green) Chlorophyll b has a conjugated pi bond system of 13 conjugated pi bonds. It looks green because it absorbs red light. Zeaxanthin (Yellow-Orange) Zeaxanthin has a conjugated pi bond system of 11 conjugated pi bonds. It looks yellow-orange because it absorbs blue-violet light. Hold on a second! Both lycopene and zeaxanthin have a conjugated pi bond system of 11 conjugated pi bonds, so why do they have different colors? Well, the number of conjugated pi bonds in a conjugated pi bond system is not the only factor that determines the color of organic compounds. Whether the conjugated pi bonds are attached to different substituents/functional groups and the location of the conjugated pi bonds also affects the wavelength absorbed. Nevertheless, determining the number of conjugated pi bonds in a conjugated pi bond system is the primary factor in determining the color of most organic compounds.  Fun fact: Bleach reacts with colored organic compounds and destroys double bonds, causing the color of the compound to disappear or lighten. This is the reason why bleach gets rid of color in clothes. Your clothes still stay stained, however the stain simply no longer shows up. "

Markdown is a simple text based formatting that anyone can do using a simple text editor and when it is processed by the right rendering engine, you get formatted text. It is much simpler than html and can very conveniently be used to write web based documents. You can learn markdown 101 here and Wikipedia has all the details you would be interested in knowing about markdown, including its history. In this article I am sharing some of the more advanced things that you can do using markdown. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through Large dashes using --- which render as — inline Adding color using html like &lt;font color= LimeGreen &gt;This text is lime green!&lt;/font&gt; renders as This text is Lime Green in color!Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this could be some inline code. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks followed by a name of the code language.
