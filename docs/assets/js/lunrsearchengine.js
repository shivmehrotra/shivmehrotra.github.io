    "body": "     Say my name.     Shiv Mehrotra.   YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT!         I am presently a senior at Interlake High School in Bellevue, Washington. I have a deep interest in science, especially chemistry and physics. This website is a dedication to both subjects. My website's name, hsnberg, is an abridged form of Heisenberg. My chemistry inspiration for Heisenberg comes from Walter White, the main character in Breaking Bad who uses the name Heisenberg as an alias.     Now please do not tell me that you have not watched Breaking Bad!     My physics inspiration for Heisenberg comes from the physicist Werner Heisenberg, discoverer of the  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.       I use my knowledge of chemistry and physics to innovate and try out new ideas that I occassionally get. I spend most of my time in chemistry and physics either studying or preparing for science competitions (it's my last year in high school, gotta make it count!).                  Now, I am not trying to become a chemistry and physics encyclopedia (although I wouldn't complain if I was one). In the disciplines of chemistry and physics lie a few sub-disciplines that are my passions. In chemistry, the sub-disciplines I love are organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. In physics, the sub-disciplines I love are electromagnetism, nuclear physics, quantum physics, and general and special relativity.                One of my most favorite parts of science is experimentation. I often implement my original ideas in real life, and it is very exciting to see the results (or shortcomings, for that matter) of my work. In chemistry labs, I often either research the properties of different reactions or try to synthesize interesting compounds using my knowledge of chemical reactions. In my physics research, I build strong magnetic fields and find applications for them. However, it often is the case that I will go on a tangent and do cool chemistry and physics tricks!                      Apart from chemistry and physics, my hobbies include playing music and chess. I play the piano, western flute, and the Indian flute (called the bansuri). Chess is my favorite board game, with my favorite opening being the Ruy Lopez. I also enjoy traveling around the world. The picture on the left is from my trip to Cancun, Mexico. As I was roaming the narrow streets of Isla Mujeres there was this person with his pet Iguana Bobby. He was more than happy to share Bobby with me for a photograph. I had so many other awesome experiences in this trip!     By the way, I really enjoy sharing my love for chemistry. You can catch me on Chemistry Stack Exchange or Brainly responding to threads where I can contribute.     That should be all about hsnberg! Hope you enjoy my website!   "

    "body": "2023/10/31 - That is me, next to my organic chemistry professor Jennie Mayer on Halloween. I dressed up as Oppenheimer, while Dr. Mayer dressed up as Mary Poppins. I had my tweed suit, brown tie, and the K-6 pin from the movie Oppenheimer. To top it off, I wore a brown pork pie hat, just like the real Oppenheimer did. Many loved my costume, but I stumbled across a common question all the time: what does the K-6 on my pin mean?I had not actually thought about it: what DOES the K-6 on my pin mean? Some joked around and said it meant kindergarten to sixth grade, and that my costume was just a fancily dressed elementary school teacher. However, with the question stuck in my mind, I got to researching the K-6 pin. Through my research, I have found that the K-6 pin was the identification number given to the real Oppenheimer when he worked at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory. Below is an actual image of Oppenheimer with this identification. The fact that the movie Oppenheimer included the K-6 pin has grown my appreciation for the movie. To the custom-made silver New Mexico belt buckle, wide brown tie, and light brown pork pie hat, Oppenheimer has definetly done its research.  With a perfect main character, a perfect movie naturally follows. Happy Halloween! "

Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: 123. my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge. Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists.

The one-liners:  If you’re not part of the solution … you’re part of the precipitate.  Old chemists never die. They just stop reacting! Wait, are all these jokes too basic for you? Because I see no reaction.  Are you made of copper and tellurim? Because you’re CuTe.  I’d give you some more chemistry jokes, but all the good ones argon.  Guys, stop it with the puns. We’ve all sulfured enough. The bar collection:  A neutron walks into a bar and asks the bartender how much a drink costs.      The bartender says, “For you, no charge. ”     Helium walks into a bar. The bartender says, “We don’t serve noble gasses here. ”     Helium doesn’t react.     Oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, sodium, and phosphorous walk into a bar.      “OH SNaP” says the bartender.
