    "body": "                Say my name.     Shiv Mehrotra.   YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT!         I am presently a senior at Interlake High School in Bellevue, Washington. I have a deep interest in science, especially chemistry and physics. This website is a dedication to both subjects. My website's name, hsnberg, is an abridged form of Heisenberg. My chemistry inspiration for Heisenberg comes from Walter White, the main character in Breaking Bad who uses the name Heisenberg as an alias.     Now please do not tell me that you have not watched Breaking Bad!     My physics inspiration for Heisenberg comes from the physicist Werner Heisenberg, discoverer of the  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.       I use my knowledge of chemistry and physics to innovate and try out new ideas that I occassionally get. I spend most of my time in chemistry and physics either studying or preparing for science competitions (it's my last year in high school, gotta make it count!).                  Now, I am not trying to become a chemistry and physics encyclopedia (although I wouldn't complain if I was one). In the disciplines of chemistry and physics lie a few sub-disciplines that are my passions. In chemistry, the sub-disciplines I love are organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. In physics, the sub-disciplines I love are electromagnetism, nuclear physics, quantum physics, and general and special relativity.      One of my most favorite parts of science is experimentation. I often implement my original ideas in real life, and it is very exciting to see the results (or shortcomings, for that matter) of my work. In chemistry labs, I often either research the properties of different reactions or try to synthesize interesting compounds using my knowledge of chemical reactions. In my physics research, I build strong magnetic fields and find applications for them. However, it often is the case that I will go on a tangent and do cool chemistry and physics tricks!             Apart from chemistry and physics, my hobbies include playing music and chess. I play the piano, western flute, and the Indian flute (called the bansuri). Chess is my favorite board game, with my favorite opening being the Ruy Lopez. I also enjoy traveling around the world. The vacation picture upi see is from my trip to Cancun, Mexico. As I was roaming the narrow streets of Isla Mujeres there was this person with his pet Iguana Bobby. He was more than happy to share Bobby with me for a photograph. I had so many other awesome experiences in this trip!     By the way, I really enjoy sharing my love for chemistry. You can catch me on Chemistry Stack Exchange or Brainly responding to threads where I can contribute.      If you enjoy chess, no matter what part of the world you are in, why not play a game with me online on chess. com?     That should be all about hsnberg! Hope you enjoy my website!             "

    "body": "2023/10/31 - That is me, next to my organic chemistry professor Jennie Mayer on Halloween. I dressed up as Oppenheimer, while professor Mayer dressed up as Mary Poppins. I had my tweed suit, brown tie, and the K-6 pin from the movie Oppenheimer. To top it off, I wore a brown pork pie hat, just like the real Oppenheimer did. Many loved my costume, but I stumbled across a common question all the time: what does the K-6 on my pin mean?I had not actually thought about it: what DOES the K-6 on my pin mean? Some joked around and said it meant kindergarten to sixth grade, and that my costume was just a fancily dressed elementary school teacher. However, with the question stuck in my mind, I got to researching the K-6 pin. Through my research, I have found that the K-6 pin was the identification number given to the real Oppenheimer when he worked at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory. Below is an actual image of Oppenheimer with this identification. The fact that the movie Oppenheimer included the K-6 pin has grown my appreciation for the movie. To the custom-made silver New Mexico belt buckle, wide brown tie, and light brown pork pie hat, Oppenheimer has definetly done its research.  With a perfect main character, a perfect movie naturally follows . . . . . . and inspires. Happy Halloween!  "

    "title": "My musical journey",
    "body": "2023/08/11 - Elementary School: I began my music journey in fourth grade. My school music teacher made the whole class learn the recorder to prepare for fifth grade, where we would be allowed to choose from many instruments. To make learning music more fun, I remember my school music teacher gave everyone a “Recorder Karate” book. Each page contained a song and a few fingerings for the recorder. Just like karate, there were white, yellow, orange, green, purple, blue, red, brown, and black belts that could be earned. The first song was a “White Belt” song, so playing the song well would earn you a white belt. Each “belt” was a rubber band of whatever color of belt you earned wrapped around the end of the recorder. As you progress through the Recorder Karate book, the songs get more challenging, but the fact that you earned a colored “belt” was enough to get me to practice my recorder every day. Eventually, I got every “belt”, with my black belt being my greatest achievement at the time.  My recorder from 4th grade, honored with the 9 belts of progression. In fifth grade, students had a choice between joining band or orchestra. My perception of bands at that time came from marching bands, and I definetly did not want to march and move awkwardly as I played my instrument, so I joined orchesta. I took the violin because it was the least hassle to carry. I felt bad for the cello and double bass players as they lugged their large instruments. The violin was fun as I learned the fingerings on each string. It was when I got into middle school when I decided that I wanted more diversity in my music experience, so I switched to band. Amongst all the wind instruments, I spent hours trying to determine which instrument I would play. I landed on the flute since it was small and did not require delicate reeds that always need moistening. Middle School: I quickly learned that playing wind instruments is different than playing string instruments. There was no bow to play the sound for me, I had to shape my mouth correctly and blow into the flute. For the first month I was met with failure as I tried to muster one note. I began greatly disliking band, wanting to return to orchestra and continue playing my violin. Unfortunately, I could not change my class from band to orchestra, meaning I would have to continue playing the flute until the end of the school year. Thankfully, I did eventually get the hang of the flute. I had even grown to become passionate for playing the flute, so I continued band into seventh grade. By this time, I thought I played very well. My father also taught me some Hindi film tunes to play on the flute. Seventh grade saw me audition for entrance into the Bellevue Youth Symphony Orchestra, but I did not get accepted. I talked to my father about getting me flute lessons to improve my flute skills. That is how I met Mrs. Rose, my flute teacher.  Under Mrs. Rose's training, my flute skills improved immediately. There were numerous things that I was previously doing incorrectly on the flute that Mrs. Rose had me correct. There is no substitute for a good teacher.  By eighth grade, I had become confident in my flute skills, and I was accepted into the Bellevue Youth Symphony Orchestra. I also competed in some music competitions in my school. My highest point in Middle school music was when I got to play at the state level in WMEA All-State Junior in February 2020, which was right before COVID shut everything down. My school closed down for the rest of the year, and all of the music events I was involved in were cancelled. By the end of the school year, I quit Bellevue Youth Symphony Orchestra to focus on my new chapter of life: high school. High School: Picture of me playing the bansuri on a stage recital arranged by my Indian classical music teacher Satyajit ji ('ji' as a suffix to the name is used to convey respect to a person in Hindi). In high school, I continued to play the flute and have lessons on it, but since I quit playing for the high school band in 9th grade, playing the flute took a backseat as I was introduced to a new instrument: the Indian flute (bansuri). My father introduced me to the bansuri since he wanted me to play Hindi film songs, and I took a liking to the bansuri because it felt and was played similar to the flute. I was fortunate to have Satyajit Limaye, an Indian classical music teacher close to where I lived. I started lessons with him. On my first class, he asked me to play what I knew on the western flute. After hearing me play, he told my father that I would quickly pick up the bansuri. As I started playing the bansuri, I found one critical difference: holes in the flute were either fully open or fully closed, while holes in the bansuri were either fully open, fully closed, or half-open (or half-closed, which one is it?). Looking at how far my fingers could stretch, Satyajit ji got me started on a ‘G’ flute. Over a period of time, my fingers got used to the stretching. With practice, playing bansuri became second nature to me. … and beyond: When I look back over these years, learning to play 4 musical instruments was quite a journey, but this journey is not over. I want to take my musical skills, engagement, and appreciation to the next level. Thus, I plan to do a minor in music in college. Let’s see what is in store for me next. "

Physics may explain why the sky and ocean are blue, but chemistry explains why sapphire is blue, why rust is a brownish red, and why pencil lead is black while diamonds are transparent (despite both things being made out of carbon). A Brief History of Colors: Colors have been used before writing was invented. For example, cave paintings contain black from charcoal and red from hematite, also known as iron (iii) oxide. Hematite contains Fe3+ ions, which have a reddish-brown color.

Markdown is a simple text based formatting that anyone can do using a simple text editor and when it is processed by the right rendering engine, you get formatted text. It is much simpler than html and can very conveniently be used to write web based documents. You can learn markdown 101 here and Wikipedia has all the details you would be interested in knowing about markdown, including its history. In this article I am sharing some of the more advanced things that you can do using markdown. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through Large dashes using --- which render as — inline Adding color using html like &lt;font color= LimeGreen &gt;This text is lime green!&lt;/font&gt; renders as This text is Lime Green in color!Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this could be some inline code.
