I have a deep interest in science, especially Chemistry. This website is a dedication to the same. The name hsnberg a 7 letter short form for heisenberg is an inspiration I drew from multiple sources. The obvious one is the Uncertainty Principle and the not so obvious one is the street name of the lead character of breaking bad Walter White, who was a High School Chemistry teacher in this widly popular sitcom.     The picture of me is frim my trip to Cancun, Mexico in December 2021 right around the time when travel was eased during COVID. I am holding an Iguana on the island of Isla de Mujeres.              Chemistry:                   You can say from my picture that I am a big fan of Chemistry. I have disappearing eyes.     Music:           I play both the Western Flute as well as the Indian Bamboo flute also known as the Bansuri. Here are pictures of me performing on stage. My dressing is Western for teh Flute and Indian for the Bansuri. For my Indian attire, I am wearing kurta pajama which is typical Indian mens' attire and sitting with my legs crossed which is how musicians from India perform.

    "body": "2023/07/06 - Not all content needs bell and whistles. Notepad style text is boring as well. Here is where we have a formatting standard called Markdown come to the rescue. Markdown is a simple text based formatting that anyone can do using a simple text editor and when it is processed by the right rendering engine, you get formatted text. It is much simpler than html and can very conveniently be used to write web based documents. You can learn markdown 101 here and Wikipedia has all the details you would be interested in knowing about markdown, including its history. In this article I am sharing some of the more advanced things that you can do using markdown. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through Large dashes using --- which render as — inline Adding color using html like &lt;font color= LimeGreen &gt;This text is lime green!&lt;/font&gt; renders as This text is Lime Green in color!Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this could be some inline code. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks followed by a name of the code language. No language hint: 123. my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}HTML: 12345&lt;li class= ml-1 mr-1 &gt;  &lt;a target= _blank  href= # &gt;  &lt;i&gt; Here I come &lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;CSS: 12345678. highlight . c {  color: #999988;  font-style: italic; }. highlight . err {  color: #a61717;  background-color: #e3d2d2; }JS: 123456789// alertbar later$(document). scroll(function () {  var y = $(this). scrollTop();  if (y &gt; 280) {    $('. alertbar'). fadeIn();  } else {    $('. alertbar'). fadeOut();  }});Python: 1print( Hello World )Reference lists: Other than the standard [Text](url) markdown format, another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material like in a publication. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. The links below have been rendered using Reference Style markdown shown in the code box below it.

    "body": "2023/06/28 - Here’s a collection of my all-time favorite one liner jokes in Chemistry. Reading through them makes me see the lighter side of Chemistry. It goes without saying that science isn’t everyone’s favorite subject in school. While some excel at biology and chemistry, others might not find it fun at all. A great way to make any subject more relatable and fun is to add humor to a lesson. Whether you’re looking for kid-friendly jokes or more mature jokes, there is tons of material out there. In other words, if you think chemistry can’t be funny, you’re wrong. From knock-knock jokes about the periodic table of elements to corny jokes about protons, neutrons, and atoms, to an endless list of chemistry puns, there are plenty of options to make you smile. If you’re a student, use these jokes to get on your teacher’s good side, and if you’re a teacher, use these to get your students to crack a smile after a particularly tough pop quiz. The one-liners:  If you’re not part of the solution … you’re part of the precipitate.  Old chemists never die. They just stop reacting! Wait, are all these jokes too basic for you? Because I see no reaction.  Are you made of copper and tellurim? Because you’re CuTe.  I’d give you some more chemistry jokes, but all the good ones argon.  Guys, stop it with the puns. We’ve all sulfured enough. The bar collection:  A neutron walks into a bar and asks the bartender how much a drink costs. “For you, no charge. ” Helium walks into a bar. The bartender says, “We don’t serve noble gasses here. ” Helium doesn’t react.  Oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, sodium, and phosphorous walk into a bar. ”OH SNaP!” says the bartender.  Fluorine and chlorine walk into a bar. The bartender greets them: “Halo gens”The Q&amp;A Collection: Click on the fuzzed out text below to reveal the answer to the one liners :)  Know any good chemistry jokes? Na Want to hear a joke about nitrogen oxide? NO! Want to hear a Potassium joke? K! Can you tell me the chemical formula for sodium hypobromite? NaBrO What are the elements of life? Lithium and Iron = LiFe What do the other elements say about hydrogen? He’s such a loner! What kind of fish is made up of only two sodium atoms? 2 Na Why are chemists great for solving problems? Because they always have a solution! Did you hear oxygen went on a date with potassium? It went OK! What do you call a plant growing in a lab? A Chemis(tree) What is uranium + fluorine + oxygen? UFO How do you laugh at a Helium Joke? He He He How often should you tell a chemistry joke? Periodically.

    "title": "The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format",
    "body": "2018/06/12 - The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.
