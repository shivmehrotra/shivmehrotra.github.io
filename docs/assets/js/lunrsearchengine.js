    "body": "                Say my name.     Shiv Mehrotra.   YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT!         I am presently a senior at Interlake High School in Bellevue, Washington. I have a deep interest in science, especially chemistry and physics. This website is a dedication to both subjects. My website's name, hsnberg, is an abridged form of Heisenberg. My chemistry inspiration for Heisenberg comes from Walter White, the main character in Breaking Bad who uses the name Heisenberg as an alias.     Now please do not tell me that you have not watched Breaking Bad!     My physics inspiration for Heisenberg comes from the physicist Werner Heisenberg, discoverer of the  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.       I use my knowledge of chemistry and physics to innovate and try out new ideas that I occassionally get. I spend most of my time in chemistry and physics either studying or preparing for science competitions (it's my last year in high school, gotta make it count!).                  Now, I am not trying to become a chemistry and physics encyclopedia (although I wouldn't complain if I was one). In the disciplines of chemistry and physics lie a few sub-disciplines that are my passions. In chemistry, the sub-disciplines I love are organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. In physics, the sub-disciplines I love are electromagnetism, nuclear physics, quantum physics, and general and special relativity.      One of my most favorite parts of science is experimentation. I often implement my original ideas in real life, and it is very exciting to see the results (or shortcomings, for that matter) of my work. In chemistry labs, I often either research the properties of different reactions or try to synthesize interesting compounds using my knowledge of chemical reactions. In my physics research, I build strong magnetic fields and find applications for them. However, it often is the case that I will go on a tangent and do cool chemistry and physics tricks!             Apart from chemistry and physics, my hobbies include playing music and chess. I play the piano, western flute, and the Indian flute (called the bansuri). Chess is my favorite board game, with my favorite opening being the Ruy Lopez. I also enjoy traveling around the world. The vacation picture upi see is from my trip to Cancun, Mexico. As I was roaming the narrow streets of Isla Mujeres there was this person with his pet Iguana Bobby. He was more than happy to share Bobby with me for a photograph. I had so many other awesome experiences in this trip!     By the way, I really enjoy sharing my love for chemistry. You can catch me on Chemistry Stack Exchange, Reddit or Brainly responding to threads where I can contribute.      If you enjoy chess, no matter what part of the world you are in, why not play a game with me online on chess. com?     That should be all about hsnberg! Hope you enjoy my website!             "

    "title": "From Alchemy to Chemistry",
    "body": "2023/11/11 - Alchemy was chemistry in its infancy. Everybody knows what fire is, it’s what happens when you burn something. Often used for cooking and warmth, fire comes from a chemical reaction called combustion. The combustion reaction is one of the first known chemical reactions that was controlled and utilized by humans. A combustion reaction is simple: you burn something with carbon and hydrogen (and maybe oxygen), and an immense amount of heat is released as the burning compound reacts with oxygen in the air to create carbon dioxide and water vapor (yes, fire makes water). Some of the first metals humans obtained in their pure form were copper, silver, and gold. Early on, humans learned that metals could be isolated and useful compounds could be created by heating metal ores and mixtures of compounds, respectively. This process gave rise to an early form of chemistry and metallurgy. As humans became acquainted with primitive chemical processes, a new field, often now called an early form of chemistry, was born: alchemy.  The birth of organic and inorganic chemistry. Alchemy was a field devoted to determining a way to make ordinary materials into gold, a highly valuable commodity. Nowadays, we know that this is not possible through chemical processes. Elements are substances that cannot be changed through chemical processes, and alchemists DEFINITELY did not know about nuclear processes that could make gold. As alchemists tried and tried and tried to create some magical substance that could turn everything into gold, alchemists accidentally discovered early chemical concepts, analytical techniques, and even new elements. Alchemist Jãbir ibn Hayyãn discovered that some substances could be broken down, while others could not. Other Arab alchemists discovered that each substance gave a colored flame when burned, what we now call the flame test. Alchemist Hennig Brand discovered the element phosphorus by boiling down his urine; he thought the golden color of urine held the secret to the magical substance that could turn anything into gold. Alchemists provided the necessary foundations for alchemy to transcend into chemistry. All they needed was some fresh air.  Alchemy had its flaws. An important theory in alchemy called the Phlogiston theory claimed the existence of a substance called phlogiston. Burning metal ores with a phlogiston-rich substance such as coal produced a metal that was infused with phlogiston from the coal. As metals rust, they lose their infused phlogiston, causing the metal to weaken and fall apart. The problem with this theory was that when metals rusted and LOST their infused phlogiston, the metals GAINED mass. The discovery of numerous gasses during the late 18th century would not only disprove the phlogiston theory, but it would also disprove the fundamentality of a common substance: air. In 1766, chemist Henry Cavendish reacted metal zinc and iron with strong acids and created what he called “inflammable gas” (hydrogen gas). Soon after, chemists Joseph Black and Joseph Priestley discovered phlogisticated air (carbon dioxide) and dephlogisticated air (oxygen gas), respectively. What made these discoveries so important was that a chemist named Antoine Lavoisier discovered that air was absorbed by metals to create rust, refuting the phlogiston theory. The discovery of oxygen gas made Antoine Lavoisier discover that air was not a fundamental substance, and a part of the air – oxygen gas – was the gas responsible for rusting metals. The discovery of oxygen gas also helped Antoine Lavoisier establish the law of conservation of mass. The law of conservation of mass states that mass is neither created nor lost in any process.  “If everything in chemistry is explained in a satisfactory manner without the help of phlogiston, it is by that reason alone infinitely probable that the principle does not exist; that it is a hypothetical body, a gratuitous supposition; indeed, it is in the principles of good logic, not to multiply bodies without necessity. ” - Antoine Lavoisier With the theory of phlogiston gone, chemistry was born. Since the work of Antoine Lavoisier, chemistry has grown remarkably. Batteries have been created, electricity has been used to isolate reactive elements, the theory of atoms has been established, subatomic particles have been discovered, even Albert Einstein contributed to chemistry by showing how the movement of atoms cause very light particles to move seemingly randomly. For a series I LOVE on the history of chemistry, you can watch the series The Mystery of Matter: Search for the Elements, links below  The Mystery of Matter: “OUT OF THIN AIR” The Mystery of Matter: “UNRULY ELEMENTS” The Mystery of Matter: “INTO THE ATOM”"

    "body": "2023/10/31 - That is me, next to my organic chemistry professor Jennie Mayer on Halloween. I dressed up as Oppenheimer, while professor Mayer dressed up as Mary Poppins. I had my tweed suit, brown tie, and the K-6 pin from the movie Oppenheimer. To top it off, I wore a brown pork pie hat, just like the real Oppenheimer did. Many loved my costume, but I stumbled across a common question all the time: what does the K-6 on my pin mean?I had not actually thought about it: what DOES the K-6 on my pin mean? Some joked around and said it meant kindergarten to sixth grade, and that my costume was just a fancily dressed elementary school teacher. However, with the question stuck in my mind, I got to researching the K-6 pin. Through my research, I have found that the K-6 pin was the identification number given to the real Oppenheimer when he worked at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory. Below is an actual image of Oppenheimer with this identification. The fact that the movie Oppenheimer included the K-6 pin has grown my appreciation for the movie. To the custom-made silver New Mexico belt buckle, wide brown tie, and light brown pork pie hat, Oppenheimer has definetly done its research.  With a perfect main character, a perfect movie naturally follows . . . . . . and inspires. Happy Halloween!  "

    "title": "My musical journey",
    "body": "2023/08/11 - Elementary School: I began my music journey in fourth grade. My school music teacher made the whole class learn the recorder to prepare for fifth grade, where we would be allowed to choose from many instruments. To make learning music more fun, I remember my school music teacher gave everyone a “Recorder Karate” book. Each page contained a song and a few fingerings for the recorder. Just like karate, there were white, yellow, orange, green, purple, blue, red, brown, and black belts that could be earned. The first song was a “White Belt” song, so playing the song well would earn you a white belt. Each “belt” was a rubber band of whatever color of belt you earned wrapped around the end of the recorder. As you progress through the Recorder Karate book, the songs get more challenging, but the fact that you earned a colored “belt” was enough to get me to practice my recorder every day. Eventually, I got every “belt”, with my black belt being my greatest achievement at the time.  My recorder from 4th grade, honored with the 9 belts of progression. In fifth grade, students had a choice between joining band or orchestra. My perception of bands at that time came from marching bands, and I definetly did not want to march and move awkwardly as I played my instrument, so I joined orchesta. I took the violin because it was the least hassle to carry. I felt bad for the cello and double bass players as they lugged their large instruments. The violin was fun as I learned the fingerings on each string. It was when I got into middle school when I decided that I wanted more diversity in my music experience, so I switched to band. Amongst all the wind instruments, I spent hours trying to determine which instrument I would play. I landed on the flute since it was small and did not require delicate reeds that always need moistening. Middle School: I quickly learned that playing wind instruments is different than playing string instruments. There was no bow to play the sound for me, I had to shape my mouth correctly and blow into the flute. For the first month I was met with failure as I tried to muster one note. I began greatly disliking band, wanting to return to orchestra and continue playing my violin. Unfortunately, I could not change my class from band to orchestra, meaning I would have to continue playing the flute until the end of the school year. Thankfully, I did eventually get the hang of the flute. I had even grown to become passionate for playing the flute, so I continued band into seventh grade. By this time, I thought I played very well. My father also taught me some Hindi film tunes to play on the flute. Seventh grade saw me audition for entrance into the Bellevue Youth Symphony Orchestra, but I did not get accepted. I talked to my father about getting me flute lessons to improve my flute skills. That is how I met Mrs. Rose, my flute teacher.  Under Mrs. Rose's training, my flute skills improved immediately. There were numerous things that I was previously doing incorrectly on the flute that Mrs. Rose had me correct. There is no substitute for a good teacher.  By eighth grade, I had become confident in my flute skills, and I was accepted into the Bellevue Youth Symphony Orchestra. I also competed in some music competitions in my school. My highest point in Middle school music was when I got to play at the state level in WMEA All-State Junior in February 2020, which was right before COVID shut everything down. My school closed down for the rest of the year, and all of the music events I was involved in were cancelled. By the end of the school year, I quit Bellevue Youth Symphony Orchestra to focus on my new chapter of life: high school. High School: Picture of me playing the bansuri on a stage recital arranged by my Indian classical music teacher Satyajit ji ('ji' as a suffix to the name is used to convey respect to a person in Hindi). In high school, I continued to play the flute and have lessons on it, but since I quit playing for the high school band in 9th grade, playing the flute took a backseat as I was introduced to a new instrument: the Indian flute (bansuri). My father introduced me to the bansuri since he wanted me to play Hindi film songs, and I took a liking to the bansuri because it felt and was played similar to the flute. I was fortunate to have Satyajit Limaye, an Indian classical music teacher close to where I lived. I started lessons with him. On my first class, he asked me to play what I knew on the western flute. After hearing me play, he told my father that I would quickly pick up the bansuri. As I started playing the bansuri, I found one critical difference: holes in the flute were either fully open or fully closed, while holes in the bansuri were either fully open, fully closed, or half-open (or half-closed, which one is it?). Looking at how far my fingers could stretch, Satyajit ji got me started on a ‘G’ flute. Over a period of time, my fingers got used to the stretching. With practice, playing bansuri became second nature to me. … and beyond: When I look back over these years, learning to play 4 musical instruments was quite a journey, but this journey is not over. I want to take my musical skills, engagement, and appreciation to the next level. Thus, I plan to do a minor in music in college. Let’s see what is in store for me next. "

    "title": "Chemistry of Colors",
    "body": "2023/07/20 - “Colors are the smiles of Nature. ” - Leigh Hunt …and true colors are the smiles of chemistry. A Brief History of Colors: Colors have been used before writing was invented. Over 200 thousand years ago, early humans ground up rocks and minerals like hematite, also known as iron (iii) oxide for cave paintings and object decoreation. Hematite contains Fe3+ ions, which have a reddish-brown color. Early humans began doing primitive chemistry to create other colors. Adding water to hematite created limonite, a mixture of multiple minerals that has a yellow color.  One of the first synthetic pigments humans made was Egyptian Blue. As the name suggests, it was made by early Egyptians around 5000 years ago. Blue-colored substances are rare in nature, so Egyptian blue allowed for a synthetic substitute for obtaining a blue color. Egyptian blue is made by heating a ground-up mixture of sand, chalk, a source of copper, and embalming salts to about 900oC for 10 to 100 hours! Jumping ahead to the 19th century, many famous artists like Vincent van Gogh came to prominence. To create paintings, artists used paints that were, and still are, created by mixing a dried and ground-up pigment, a solvent to make the paint liquid, and a binder that keeps the pigment and solvent from separating. Vincent van Gogh's famous painting at the beginning of this post uses a multitude of compounds to create color. Black was made from crushed sources of carbon such as charred bones, white was made from lead salts (which we now know are toxic), red was made from toxic mercury compounds, blue was made from iron compounds, yellow was made from a mixture of lead and chromium, and a deep green was made from a mixture of copper and arsenic (arsenic being toxic, many artists, including Vincent van Gogh, grew insane from arsenic poisoning).  Further research: PBS Studios - The Chemistry of Color The Basics of Color: Before we can understand how chemistry plays a role in coloring compounds, we must learn why colors exist in the first place. Our eyes see a range of light called the visible spectrum; light outside of the visible spectrum range is invisible to our eyes. When an object has a color, it means that the object does not absorb, but reflect that color. For example, a red book does not absorb red light, so red light reflects off the book and reaches our eye, making the book look red. Therefore, if an object absorbs a color, the object’s color will be the color opposite to the absorbed color on the color wheel (two colors that are opposite to each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors).  Based on the color wheel above, an object that absorbs orange light will look blue, and an object that absorbs blue-green light will have an orange-red look. Transparent objects do not reflect light, but instead let unabsorbed light pass through itself. Black objects absorb almost all visible light, and white objects reflect almost all visible light. The Organic Side of Colors: So what gives compounds their color? Lycopene (a red pigment found in tomatoes), zeaxanthin (an orange-red compound found in wolfberries), lutein (a yellow compound found in egg yolks), chlorophyll b (a green compound found in plants), indigotin (a blue compound in indigo dye), and petunidin (a purple compound found in some grapes) are organic compounds whose colors range throughout the visible spectrum. The cause for the variety of color? Conjugated pi bonds. Pi bonds are in double and triple bonds in molecules. Conjugated pi bonds mean that there is an alternating pattern of double/triple bond, single bond, double/triple bond, single bond, etc.  Molecule of Beta Carotene showing an alternating pattern of 11 double bonds (conjugated pi bonds). It is orange-red in color and found in carrots. Compounds with a large continuous conjugated pi bond system generally absorb light in the visible spectrum. The larger the conjugated pi bond system, the longer the wavelength of light that is absorbed. This is because each pi bond has two energy levels: one in a bonding orbital and the other in an antibonding orbital. Each orbital holds up to two electrons, with the lower energy levels getting filled up before the higher energy levels. The bonding orbitals are the lower energy levels, while the antibonding orbitals are the higher energy levels. Thus, when there are n conjugated pi bonds in a conjugated pi bond system, there exist 2n electrons in the conjugated pi bond system, n bonding orbitals in the conjugated pi bond system, and n antibonding orbitals in the conjugated pi bond system. In the image below, antibonding orbitals are marked with a * HOMO = Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital, LUMO = Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital The wavelength of light increases going from violet to red to light. As the wavelength of light increases, the energy of the light decreases. Usually, the conjugated pi bond system must have more than eight continuously conjugated pi bonds to go from absorbing UV light to visible light, producing a visible color. How about some examples? Isophorone (Colorless) Isophorone has a conjugated pi bond system of only two conjugated pi bonds. It is colorless. Lycopene (Red) Lycopene has a conjugated pi bond system of 11 conjugated pi bonds. It looks red because it absorbs green light; green and red are complimentary colors. Chlorophyll b (Green) Chlorophyll b has a conjugated pi bond system of 13 conjugated pi bonds. It looks green because it absorbs red light. Zeaxanthin (Yellow-Orange) Zeaxanthin has a conjugated pi bond system of 11 conjugated pi bonds. It looks yellow-orange because it absorbs blue-violet light. Hold on a second! Both lycopene and zeaxanthin have a conjugated pi bond system of 11 conjugated pi bonds, so why do they have different colors? Well, the number of conjugated pi bonds in a conjugated pi bond system is not the only factor that determines the color of organic compounds. Whether the conjugated pi bonds are attached to different substituents/functional groups and the location of the conjugated pi bonds also affects the wavelength absorbed. Nevertheless, determining the number of conjugated pi bonds in a conjugated pi bond system is the primary factor in determining the color of most organic compounds.  Fun fact: Bleach reacts with colored organic compounds and destroys double bonds, causing the color of the compound to disappear or lighten. This is the reason why bleach gets rid of color in clothes. Your clothes still stay stained, however the stain simply no longer shows up. "

    "body": "2023/07/06 - Not all content needs bell and whistles. Notepad style text is boring as well. This is where a formatting standard called Markdown comes to the rescue. Markdown is a simple text based formatting that anyone can do using a simple text editor and when it is processed by the right rendering engine, you get formatted text. It is much simpler than html and can very conveniently be used to write web based documents. You can learn markdown 101 here and Wikipedia has all the details you would be interested in knowing about markdown, including its history. In this article I am sharing some of the more advanced things that you can do using markdown. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through Large dashes using --- which render as — inline Adding color using html like &lt;font color= LimeGreen &gt;This text is lime green!&lt;/font&gt; renders as This text is Lime Green in color!Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this could be some inline code. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks followed by a name of the code language. No language hint: 123. my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}HTML: 12345&lt;li class= ml-1 mr-1 &gt;  &lt;a target= _blank  href= # &gt;  &lt;i&gt; Here I come &lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;CSS: 12345678. highlight . c {  color: #999988;  font-style: italic; }. highlight . err {  color: #a61717;  background-color: #e3d2d2; }JS: 123456789// alertbar later$(document). scroll(function () {  var y = $(this). scrollTop();  if (y &gt; 280) {    $('. alertbar'). fadeIn();  } else {    $('. alertbar'). fadeOut();  }});Python: 1print( Hello World )Reference lists: Other than the standard [Text](url) markdown format, another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material like in a publication. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. The links below have been rendered using Reference Style markdown shown in the code box below it.

    "body": "2023/06/28 - Here’s a collection of my all-time favorite one liner jokes in chemistry. Reading through them makes me see the lighter side of chemistry. The one-liners:  If you’re not part of the solution … you’re part of the precipitate.  Old chemists never die. They just stop reacting! Wait, are all these jokes too basic for you? Because I see no reaction.  Are you made of copper and tellurim? Because you’re CuTe.  I’d give you some more chemistry jokes, but all the good ones argon.  Guys, stop it with the puns. We’ve all sulfured enough. The bar collection:  A neutron walks into a bar and asks the bartender how much a drink costs.      The bartender says, “For you, no charge. ”     Helium walks into a bar. The bartender says, “We don’t serve noble gasses here. ”     Helium doesn’t react.     Oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, sodium, and phosphorous walk into a bar.      “OH SNaP” says the bartender.     Fluorine and chlorine walk into a bar.      The bartender greets them: “Halo gens”    The Q&amp;A collection: Click on the fuzzed out text below to reveal the answer to the one liners :)  Know any good chemistry jokes? Na Want to hear a joke about nitrogen oxide? NO! Want to hear a Potassium joke? K! Can you tell me the chemical formula for sodium hypobromite? NaBrO What are the elements of life? Lithium and Iron = LiFe What do the other elements say about hydrogen? He’s such a loner! What kind of fish is made up of only two sodium atoms? 2 Na Why are chemists great for solving problems? Because they always have a solution! Did you hear oxygen went on a date with potassium? It went OK! What do you call a plant growing in a lab? A Chemis(tree) What is uranium + fluorine + oxygen?
